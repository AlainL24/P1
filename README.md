Hello,
My name is Alain and this version of the game is called Spaceman. 
Although I have never played this version of Hangman I was intrigued by the concept and wanted to make my own version.
The game is very straight forward, 
You get to try and save the astronaut's life by correctly guessing the word.
If not, The astronaut will vanish.
Please try your best to save him!
